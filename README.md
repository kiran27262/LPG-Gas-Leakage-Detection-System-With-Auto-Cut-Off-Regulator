LPG Gas Leakage Detection System with Auto Cut-Off Regulator

🔹 Project Overview

This project is an Arduino-based LPG Gas Leakage Detection System with an automatic gas cut-off regulator designed to prevent accidents caused by gas leaks.
It uses an MQ-2 gas sensor to detect LPG leakage and automatically activates a servo motor to shut off the gas supply. At the same time, it triggers a buzzer and fan to alert and ventilate the area.

🎯 Objective

Detect LPG gas leakage automatically using an MQ-2 sensor.

Instantly cut off gas supply through a servo-controlled regulator.

Provide buzzer and ventilation alerts to prevent accidents.

Create a cost-effective and reliable safety system for homes and industries.

⚙️ Hardware Used

Arduino UNO (Rev 3)

MQ-2 Gas Sensor

Servo Motor

Buzzer

Relay Module

Cooling Fan

🔬 Working Principle

The MQ-2 sensor detects gas concentration in the air.

If the level crosses a safe limit, Arduino triggers:

Buzzer → Alerts users

Servo Motor → Turns regulator OFF

Fan → Ventilates the area

The system acts instantly to stop leakage and reduce risk.

📈 Results

Quick and accurate leak detection.

Fast automatic shut-off response.

Reliable performance compared to manual methods.

Simple, affordable, and efficient design.
